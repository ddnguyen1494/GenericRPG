# GenericRPG

# Initial concept:

* User chooses login or signup

* User chooses an existing character or creates a new character. 

* If the user creates a new character, they must choose their name, class, race, abilities, stats, and starting item. The terminal then provides some backstory.

* Once the user has a character, they enter the main game and a turn begins. The user sees a map, stats, and text with further options. 

* The user can choose to quit at any time. If the user dies, they can quit, create a new character, or wait to be resurrected.
